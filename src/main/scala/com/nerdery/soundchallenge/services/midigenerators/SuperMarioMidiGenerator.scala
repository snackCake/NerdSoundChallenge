/**
 * @author Justin Mullin
 *
 * Super Mario World #1 - the one, the only, the classic.
 *
 * Sincerest apologies to Ryan Evans for (accidentally) copying his idea!
 *
 * Transcribed by hand from sheet music at
 *   http://www.gamemusicthemes.com/sheetmusic/nintendo/supermariobros/overworldtheme/
 *
 * The basic components of the DSL are as follows:
 *
 * Pitch: pitches are defined by specifying a key and an octave separated by a tilde.
 *   example: C~4 for middle C
 *
 * Note: a song is composed up of some number of notes, which are defined as a pitch and a duration, represented
 * by a multiplication sign.  Common durations are exposed as constants, and dotted/triplet durations are accessible
 * as methods on the duration.
 *   example: C~4 * Eighth.triplet
 *
 * Runs: notes are contained within runs, which provide structure.  There are two kinds of runs, parallel and
 * sequential.  Parallel runs align their children to play simultaneously, while sequential runs align their
 * notes to play one after another.
 * Runs can be nested within each other to build the structure for a song and repeated as necessary.  When
 * the MIDI file is generated, the runs will determine by relative position when each note should play.
 *   example: SequentialRun(C~4 * Quarter, E~4 * Quarter, G~4 * Quarter) repeat 3
 *
 * Chords: a chord is simply a small convenience wrapper around a parallel run to simplify construction.  To
 * instantiate a chord, use the + operator to string together two or more pitches, then assign a duration to the chord
 * as you would a single pitch.
 *   example: (C~4 + E~4 + G~4) * Whole
 *
